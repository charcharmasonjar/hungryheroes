### Restaurant owner
 Its a dark and stormy night. Rain rattles along the rooftops and a cold wind whips through the Granville st. For it is in Vancouver where our scene lies...
Toby wants to make it easier for his customers that order pick up for his restuarant. Usually people order over the phone or order in
person but they have to wait in the entry area and end up blocking customers coming for sit in dining.
He wants his business to be avaiable online for customers to order and pick up and save those customers orders/payments for future reference 
when they visit the site again.
He wants to put his menu items online and offer a variety of sides and be able to remove and add menu items from the site or add weekly specials.


(STRETCH) He would like it if the site could show their lunch menu and dinner menu for appropriate times of day that they are available.
