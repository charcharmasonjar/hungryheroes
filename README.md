# HUNGRY HEROES



A food pick-up ordering app built for a restaurant as a midterm project at Lighthouse Labs. The app allows a customer user to place an order on the restaurant's web page. Placing an order notifies the restaurant with order details and the restaurant can confirm the order with an estimated wait time and follow up with another stating that the customer's order is ready for pick-up.

Front-end built using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript, AJAX

Back-end was built using Node.js, Express, and PostreSQL

Twilio API (modern telecomm API service) was used to allow text messages bewteen the customer and restaurant

Ngrok for establishing secure tunnels from a public endpoint to a locally running network service

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`

  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- The text response from restaurant should be formatted as "order number(integer), added prep time(integer), order status(boolean)" 
- Example "12 20 false"
